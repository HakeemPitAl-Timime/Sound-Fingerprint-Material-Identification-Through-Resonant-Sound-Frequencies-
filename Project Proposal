Fields: Physics and Computer Science 

-------------------------------------------------------Project Type--------------------------------------------------------

Software development project with an experimental data collection component (machine learning–based object/material identification using acoustic resonance analysis). 

--------------------------------------------------Integration and context--------------------------------------------------

This project incorporates physics and computer science through the experimental analysis and computational classification of wave signals generated by resonant vibrations. The physics component involves how different materials generate resonant frequencies, 
how such frequencies relate to the material's physical properties, and how wave behaviors can be demonstrated mathematically. The computer science component involves recording digital signals, extracting explicit major features from those signals, and 
applying machine learning algorithms to classify and evaluate the prediction of accuracy based on these features. 

Knowledge and teachings from a past course, Waves and Modern Physics, provides the theoretical background required to recognise sound as a mechanical wave, comprehend resonance frequencies and use it to calculate its wavelength, and 
analyse damping behavior over time. Concepts such as harmonic motion, wave propagation, and Fourier analysis are directly applied in this project.  The courses Introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Programming provide the 
computational foundation necessary to implement signal recognition algorithms, manipulate datasets, and design the machine learning classification program in Python. 

The integration between the two disciplines occurs throughout the project. Initially, the system will attempt classification of the dominant frequency attained from the recorded signal while also cancelling irrelevant frequencies and noises.  
Next, other physics-derived properties such as wavelength, calculated using the speed of sound, will be incorporated as new input features. Finally, a third measurable property such as temporal decay or spectral distribution will be used. 
At each stage, classification accuracy will be evaluated to establish the practicality of additional physics information. This staged approach allows direct evaluation of how physical modelling contributes to computational accuracy. 

----------------------------------------------------Project Introduction----------------------------------------------------

Identifying the material and/or object by means of acoustic signals involves several disciplines (Physics, Signal Processing & Machine Learning) and is often considered an interdisciplinary challenge. 
When an object is struck lightly, it creates a sound, which is defined, in part, by the mechanical properties of that object, and is characterized by its resonant frequencies, and how long it will continue 
to resonate (temporal decay). The characteristics of the sound (acoustic signals) produced from a vibrating object depend on several physical attributes of the object (e.g., density, elasticity, geometry, and internal energy loss). 
All materials behave differently based on the combination of these attributes. Therefore, it should be possible to use the sound signals generated by multiple objects to discriminate between different objects and/or object types. 

The foundations upon which these physics are based are resonance and wave propagation. Vibrating objects produce pressure waves in the surrounding air, which travel at the speed of sound. It is these waves that can be picked up by a 
microphone. The recorded signal contains dominant frequencies which correspond to the natural modes of vibration that occur through the object. Additionally, energy dissipation is associated with the rate at which the amplitude diminishes 
over time within the material. Previously completed research has found that material characteristics and structural differences can be inferred using acoustic responses, demonstrating that physical information can be derived from recorded 
sound signals [1,2]. 

Converting analog (physical) into digital (completely electronic) signals requires sampling (using a method of taking multiple measurements per unit time - usually around 16 kHz) such that the sampling rate provides enough frequency information 
from the source of the sound being sampled [3]. The 16 kHz frequency also assists to facilitate the evaluation of the analog acoustics signals using the computational processing required to do an analysis of the frequency of ways (the Fourier Transform) 
of the captured frequency components by converting each wave captured from time domain to frequency domain. The ability to analyze only the frequencies present in each of the wave components produced will enable the extraction of the necessary data 
for collaboration with machine-learning algorithms for classification [4]. 

Machine learning methods have been successfully applied to a wide range of audio recognition problems, including speech processing, music categorization, and environmental sound detection [4]. In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on 
labeled datasets so that they can learn relationships between measurable features and classification categories. After training, the model can predict the category of new, previously unseen data. This approach is well suited for our project, where 
recorded tapping sounds will be labeled according to the object or material that produced them. 

The aim of this project is to create and implement a software application that can determine the category of common items or materials by listening to their sounds when tapped. The application will allow for audio input in real-time or from a recording 
to be submitted to the application so that it can extract necessary features for sending them to a machine learning model that has been trained and generates a prediction for the probable category as well as an associated confidence level. There will also 
be a graphical representation of the sound waveform and frequency spectrum, which will help provide details about how the classification and prediction took place. 

This project has a key objective: to incrementally include physics-based information in a classification process. The first step of the system will classify an object using only one measurement (the dominant sound frequency). By doing this, we'll be 
able to see how well the prediction system performs when only one input measurement is used. One step we will take next is to incorporate the wavelength of the measured frequency into the classification model. The wavelength can be determined from the 
speed of sound in air. The relationships between frequency and wavelength via how waves behave give the necessary connections for including physics in a computational model as a means to perform classifications. The final step in this project will include 
an additional property associated with each sound signal (such as how long the vibration takes to decay or how energy is distributed over an entire spectrum). By measuring and comparing the performance and accuracy of this classification process through each 
of these stages, this project will show an increase in performance through including additional physics-based data. 

An experimental database will be compiled by capturing numerous measurements from a small number of objects repeatedly in a controlled environment. The microphone and object distances will be held constant; however, we will test variations 
(in terms of tapping force and angle of impact) to help our model have a greater level of robustness against noise. Several recordings (per object) will be made to allow the model to generalize across more realistic variations of the data, while still being 
able to keep the data in the same experimental setting. 

There are many applications for this research project in relation to acoustic sensing because it assesses whether the use of consumer-grade recording equipment (i.e., inexpensive) and incremental integration of physics-based features will provide 
acceptable classification performance. Most current systems use sophisticated sensors or high-end instrumentation and thus do not demonstrate how to classify material samples with effectiveness and accessibility through the use of affordable recording equipment 
in conjunction with computer analysis tools. Examples of possible applications include educational materials related to demonstrating resonance, inexpensive material identification systems, and automated inspection technology. 

In contrast to current efforts on this topic, the emphasis of this project will be on the continuous integration of physical parameters into a ML model and then on the evaluation of their influence on predictive accuracy. Instead of only using computation 
to extract features, this approach will investigate the value of utilizing theoretical relationships in physics to improve the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes. The project will attempt to establish that a functional object identification 
system can be created using machine learning techniques that combine concepts from resonance physics with machine learning methods while also providing insight into the relationship between physical modeling and the prediction produced via computation.
